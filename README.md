# Stroke-MViT-GAN
Stroke-MViT-GAN: An innovative CycleGAN-based framework that integrates Mobile Vision Transformer (MViT) and a specialized stroke module for sketch style transfer. Our model leverages multiple loss functions to generate high-quality, stylized sketches, bridging the gap between hand-drawn artistry and AI-driven image synthesis.
